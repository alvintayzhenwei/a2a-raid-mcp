"""The published dependency metadata has to match the API this code actually uses.

Regression guard. `server.py` imports `mcp.server.fastmcp.FastMCP`, which mcp 2.0
renamed to `mcp.server.mcpserver.MCPServer` and deleted. The manifest declared
`mcp>=1.12` with no upper bound, so `uvx a2a-raid-mcp` resolved mcp 2.1.1 and the
server died at import with

    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp.server.fastmcp'

before registering a single tool — which is every visitor who followed the connect
panel's own copy-paste install line. Nothing in the test suite noticed, because the
suite runs against a locked dev environment that already had mcp 1.x; only a FRESH
resolve picks the new major. So the thing worth testing is the METADATA, not the
import.
